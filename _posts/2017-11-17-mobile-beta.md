summary: Open beta for a new OpenDota mobile application

As some of you may know, the mobile application for OpenDota has been in development for a while. Now, we are proud to announce that the application is now in Open Beta!
The application is developed in React Native so that both the iOS and Android builds are made from the same codebase.

For those of you who are interested in beta testing the OpenDota mobile application, please send me (via Reddit PM or Discord PM) your email address & device type (e.g. iPhone X, Google Pixel 2, etc).

The download and install instruction can be found in our mobile repo: https://github.com/odota/mobile
