summary:    Some organizational changes

The OpenDota project has operated as a personal project (for tax purposes) for the past three years.
However, as the project has grown (now exceeding $30,000 in annual revenue), we feel that it is now time to make some organizational changes.

* Albert and Howard, the project founders, will create a holding company, which will administer the opendota.com service and pay taxes on its revenues as a legal entity.
  * We are committed to keeping the opendota.com service free of charge for users.
  * The costs of the service will be funded by sponsors.
  * If you are interested in sponsoring, please contact albertqcui@gmail.com
* The project code will remain fully open source and maintained by volunteer developers in the community.
 * We are also changing the license on odota/core from the GPLv3 to the MIT License, which is more permissive.
 * We want to ensure that the code is easily usable by anyone and free of legal issues.
 * Any features/fixes from Albert/Howard will continue to be contributed back to the open-source repository.
* Since the service at opendota.com is now commercial, we will no longer be accepting donations.
  * We will be decommissioning carry.opendota.com and the donation system.
  * Existing cheese counts will be preserved and the profile icon will remain on donators' profile pages.
