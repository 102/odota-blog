For the past three years, The OpenDota Project has operated as a personal project for tax purposes (sole proprietorship). However, the project has grown over the years and now exceeds $30,000 in annual revenue, and we feel that it is finally time to make some organizational changes. The details are as follows:

* Albert and Howard, the project founders, will create a holding company which will administer opendota.com and pay taxes on its revenues as an official legal entity. 
* We don't anticipate any changes to the end-user experience. We are committed to maintaining feature parity for all users, so everyone can have access to the same functionality regardless of socioeconomic status.
* The costs of hosting the opendota.com API will be funded by sponsors, who get product placement on the public hosted OpenDota UI (www.opendota.com).
* We are planning to phase out donations from individual users, decommissioning carry.opendota.com and the donation system.
  * For the past 18 months, sponsors have more than covered the operating costs of the service. We retained a token $100 per month goal for the site footer (roughly 5% of operating costs), just to show some progress for those interested in donating. We've found that setting the value too high causes people to make panicked Reddit threads, so we've been careful about keeping the value low.
  * Our goal has always been to build a service that's sustainable in the long-term, and sponsors have proven to be an effective way of achieving that goal.
  * If circumstances change in the future, we may re-enable individual contributions, possibly through Patreon or another similar platform.
* Existing cheese counts and profile icons will be preserved on individual profile pages.
* The project codebase will remain fully open source and maintained by volunteer developers in the community.
  * Any features/fixes from Albert/Howard will continue to be contributed to the open-source repository.
  * Additionally, we are relicensing odota/core from GPLv3 to The MIT License, which is more permissive. We want to ensure that the code is easily usable by anyone without any legal encumbrances.
* If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please contact sponsor@opendota.com

We believe these changes make the most sense given how The OpenDota Project has come to operate in the past few years and how we envision it continuing to operate in the future. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to any of us and we would be more than happy to discuss our motivations for these changes.

Happy Dota, everyone!
