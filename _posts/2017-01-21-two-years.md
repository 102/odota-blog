It's been two years since the initial release of [The OpenDota Project](https://github.com/odota)! First and foremost we would like to thank all of our users, [cheese-buyers](https://carry.opendota.com/), and sponsors. We hope you're all enjoying the platform! 

Some numbers:

* Over 270,000 registered users
* Over 70,000 matches parsed per day
* 6500+ overall commits to the core, 1700+ to the UI
* 70 contributors across the UI and core

Some of the major changes we've made this past year:

* Data migration: More than 1 billion matches moved from PostgreSQL to Cassandra to greatly improve load times
* The codebase split: A [React UI](https://github.com/odota/ui) for casual users and [Node.js API](https://github.com/odota/core) to power the community's apps
* [Translation](https://translate.opendota.com): Making the UI available in multiple languages through a community translation effort
* A rename (from YASP to OpenDota)

As always, if you have any suggestions for how we can improve your experience, please [let us know](https://discord.gg/0o5SQGbXuWCNDcaF) or even [submit a pull request](https://github.com/odota) yourself! OpenDota remains a volunteer-powered project and wouldn't be possible without the many developers who contribute their time and expertise.

Happy Dota, and here's to an even better year three!
